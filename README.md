# Typeracer-CEP-WA1
This is the repo for the code for my WA1 Typeracer game for CEP.

It uses React.js. To initialise, create a folder with everything in the repo, and run: npx create-react-app (name of new folder)
cd (name of new folder)
in it. Then, put all the files/folders from the repo into the new folder, and run npm start.
